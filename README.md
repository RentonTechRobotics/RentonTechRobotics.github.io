# RTC Robotics Club

Welcome to the RTC Robotics Club! Weâ€™re a dedicated team of students passionate about exploring, designing, and building robotic systems together.

## Club Purpose

The RTC Robotics Club aims to create an inclusive, hands-on environment for students of all skill levels to explore robotics and mechatronics. Our purpose is twofold:

1. To foster learning through both individual and team-driven projects, where members can experiment, create, and improve their technical skills.
2. To provide a collaborative space where students can share ideas, learn from each other, and tackle exciting real-world challenges in robotics and automation.

Everyone, from beginners to experienced robotics enthusiasts, is encouraged to join and contribute. We believe that robotics is for everyone, and we strive to make every member feel welcome.
